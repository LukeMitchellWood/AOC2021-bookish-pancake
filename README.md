# AOC2021-bookish-pancake

My entries for the 2021 Advent of Code event. I'm trying as best as I can to write (reletavly) clean, readable, and easy to understand code. I'm only competing against myself with this one. I'd like it if any of my friends could suggest improvments in readability or clarity.
